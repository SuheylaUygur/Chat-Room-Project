## About Basic Laravel Project : Chat Room Project

  

This Laravel application sets up a system where you can chat with each other. After users complete the registration process, they appear in the chat room. When you click on the person you want to talk to, you can communicate easily. In addition, there is a profile page where the user can see their information.

----
Since I don't use socket in this project, I refresh the page every 3 seconds so that the messages from the opposite side fall on the page.  

----
	The project is available for develop! Many additions can be made.

----
We write the parts related to the database connection in laravel .env, in this way we provide a database connection.

	While creating the Laravel project, we use ubuntu and thus we create a wsl connection. Then we write sail up -d command to the terminal to run localhost/login.
